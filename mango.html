    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mango trees are evergreen trees with a thick trunk and wide canopy.</li>
        <li>They can grow to a height of 100 feet or more with a canopy extending to about 35 feet or more, depending upon the climate and richness of the soil.</li>
        <li>The leaves are leathery, lanceolate, and found in simple-alternate arrangement on the branches.</li>
        <li>They are dark green and about 5â€“16 inches in length.</li>
        <li>Flowers are borne in panicles 4â€“16 inches long and have several hundred small, white flowers that are 1/4-inch wide when fully open.</li>
        <li>Most of the flowers function as male flowers, but some are bisexual and form fruits after pollination.</li>
        <li>The mango is called the "King of Fruits" due to its creamy, rich taste and aromatic flavor.</li>
        <li>The fruit of the mango tree is a drupe that varies in size and shape with shades of red and yellow or dull green.</li>
        <li>The fruit can be oval, round, heart-shaped, kidney-shaped, or long and slender.</li>
        <li>It has a single flat, large seed with a surrounding fleshy layer.</li>

            <li> It should be planted at a minimum distance of 8 meters between two plants.
                <li> Mango trees require full sunlight to fruit well. It will grow in lesser light but not fruit well or may not fruit at all.
                    <li> Grafted plants are planted as seed ones are not true to type.
                        <li> Good soil preperation is required.

        <li>Pits of 1 meter width x 1 meter length x 1 meter deep should be taken.
        <li>Top soil from these pits should be mixed with 50 kgs farm yard manure / well decomposed cow dung manure, 2 kgs of bone meal, 2 kgs of single super phosphate and 50 gms follidol dust.
        <li>Mix evenly to ensure proper distribution of the manure, fertilizer and pesticide.
        <li> Watering can be done every 10 to 15 days in winter and at weekly intervals during summer.
